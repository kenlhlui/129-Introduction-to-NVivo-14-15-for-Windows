# Introduction to NVivo 14/15 for Windows | Map and Data Library

This is a beginner level tutorial for NVivo 14 or 15 for Windows (the versions are almost identical). The goal of this tutorial is to learn about the basic features in NVivo that will allow you to organize and analyze qualitative data. Part 1 will go over the basics of navigating the NVivo interface, importing data, and coding with codes. Part 2 will explore the different types of queries you can run in NVivo. If you already have a grasp of the basics and are just interested in learning about queries, you can jump right to Part 2\.

Before you begin, make sure you have NVivo 14 or 15 installed. If you don’t, [follow these instructions to request a free license key and install the software](https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/technology/tutorials/installing-and-licensing-nvivo-14-or-15-windows).

You’ll also need to download some datasets that we’ve provided for this tutorial. Create a new folder on your computer to store the tutorial files. Download [this zip file containing all the datasets you will need for the tutorial](https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/workshops/NVivoOnline/Windows/WorkshopFiles.zip) to that new folder. Finally, extract the files into that new folder.

This tutorial is adapted from a recorded NVivo 12 workshop, which you can view [here](https://play.library.utoronto.ca/watch/236b6b5e62ca4978dfd7acb16491e93b).

Part 1 – The Basics
===================

Creating a New Project
----------------------

1\. First start up NVivo 14 or 15 from the main screen you can start a new project, open some sample projects, and access several resources for learning and using NVivo. We will look at a sample project later. For now, **click on New Project** to get started.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_001_1.PNG' alt='The NVivo 14 main screen with the bank project button outlined.' title='' width='1316' height='685' />

2\. **Title your project**. For this tutorial we will name ours “NVivo Workshop”. If you’d like, you can add a description.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_002_0.PNG' alt='Project save window. Title field outlined.' title='' width='649' height='410' />

3\. Next, **browse to where you want to save the project file**. Let’s save it in our workshop folder.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_003.PNG' alt='Project save window. File Browse outlined.' title='' width='649' height='410' />

4\. **Check the “Keep a log of user actions” option and select Next**. This will record everything you do in NVivo in a log file. If you have any issues and contact Lumivero for help, their customer service representatives might ask you for this log file, as it will help them troubleshoot your problems.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_004.PNG' alt='Project save window. Box checked for keep a log of user actions..' title='' width='645' height='407' />

5\. The next page has some save and recovery settings. We can keep the defaults, so finally **select Create Project** to create your new project.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_005.PNG' alt='Project save window. Box checked for create project. ' title='' width='650' height='408' />

 

Explore the Interface
---------------------

1\. Let’s briefly look around before we get started. First off, NVivo will present you with a tour of the tool. You can just close that window for now.

2\. The left side menu helps you navigate the various items of your project, such as your files, codes, notes, queries, etc. We will look at these sections as we use the tool.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_006.PNG' alt='NVivo main window, red box around left menu.' title='' width='1525' height='838' />

3\. At the top are various ribbon menus, similar to Microsoft tools, such as Word or Excel. These menus and their options will change depending on what is selected.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_007.PNG' alt='NVivo main window, red box around top ribbon menus.' title='' width='1525' height='838' />

4\. NVivo will ask you to save your project every 15 minutes. But if you want to save it manually, create or open a new project, get help or change your program settings, you can use the File menu at the top left.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_008.PNG' alt='Red box around the file menu in the top ribbon.' title='' width='1525' height='838' />

5\. If you **select File**, and **then Product Info**, you will see an option for **Manage License**, where you can update your license key, when you receive a new one.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_009.PNG' alt='File menu screen with the product info tab and manage license outlined.' title='' width='895' height='453' />

6\. **Click on the top left arrow** to get back to NVivo’s main screen.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_010.PNG' alt='Back arrow at the top of the file menu screen outlined.' title='' width='846' height='532' /> 

 

Import Data
-----------

Next, let’s import some data so we can start using the tool. We will be using transcripts from interviews and focus groups run for a US data center study. As mentioned before, NVivo helps you get organized, so before we import in some data, let’s create some folders to organize our data.

1\. From the left menu, **expand Data**, then **right click on Files** and **select New Folder**. Call it “Interviews”.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_011.PNG' alt='Left menu with the Data folder expanded and right click menu outlined.' title='' width='935' height='845' />

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_012_1.PNG' alt='New Folder window with the name field outlined and completed.' title='' width='394' height='186' />

2\. Create another folder called “Focus Groups”.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_013.PNG' alt='Left Menu with a red box outlining the expanded data folder. Within it Files is also expanded, with folders Focus Groups and Interviews under it.' title='' width='1388' height='930' />

3\. Next, **select the Import ribbon** at the top left. Here you can see all the broad types of information that NVivo can import.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_014.PNG' alt='Top menu with Import outlined.' title='' width='1390' height='894' />

4\. To start, let’s import in our interview transcripts. **Make sure that the Interviews folder is selected** on the left. Then **select Files** from the Import Ribbon.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_015.PNG' alt='The interview folder in the left menu is selected and outlined. In the Import Ribbon, Files is outlined.' title='' width='1390' height='894' />

5\. **Browse to the folder called “DCEE Focus Groups and Interviews,”** which has all the study files we will use in this tutorial.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_016_0.PNG' alt='Import Files window at the workshop folder, with the DCEE Focus Groups and Interviews folder highlighted.' title='' width='851' height='520' />

6\. If you **select the Supported Files drop\-down menu** at the bottom right of the pop\-up window, you will see all the different file types that you can import into NVivo from this option. In our case, we are starting with .docx files (i.e., MS Word files), so make sure to select Document Files.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_017_0.PNG' alt='Import Files window at the DCEE Focus Groups and Interviews folder. Supported formats drop-down menu highlighted with Document Files selected.' title='' width='873' height='597' />

7\. **Highlight only the files starting with “Data Center Interview” in the title** in our folder by selecting the first one, holding down the Shift key, and then selecting the last one. You should have 7 files highlighted. Then **select Open**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/nvivo_workshop_win_017.png' alt='Import Files window at the DCEE Focus Groups and Interviews folder, all Data Center Interview files highlighted and selected. Red box around the open button.' title='' width='929' height='528' />

8\. **Select Import** to import those interview transcripts into the Interviews folder. Ignore the “Create a case” option for now. We will discuss it later.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_019_0.PNG' alt='Import Files window with a red box around the Import Button.' title='' width='476' height='143' />

9\. Let’s do something similar to import in the focus group information. **Select the Focus Groups folder** on the left. Then go to the **Import menu** and **select Files**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_020.PNG' alt='The Focus Groups folder in the left menu is selected and outlined. In the Import Ribbon, Files is outlined.' title='' width='916' height='595' />

10\. You should still be in the same folder when you select Browse. This time **highlight the files with “FG” in the title**. You should have 8 files. Keep the default, Supported Files selected. This will allow you to import a combination of word files and PDFs in one go. Then **select Open**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_021.PNG' alt='Import Files window at the DCEE Focus Groups and Interviews folder, all NYC Data Center files highlighted and selected. Red box around the open button.' title='' width='842' height='513' />

11\. Then **select Import** to import those focus groups files to the Focus Groups folder.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_022.PNG' alt='Import Files window with a red box around the Import Button.' title='' width='477' height='143' />

12\. These files are now all copied into your project file. You can see from the Import ribbon that there are many different types of information that can be imported. For example, you can connect to survey tools or reference managers to pull in your data, or from the Files option, you can import in audio files, images, or videos. Click on the small drop\-down arrows beside "Survey", "Classifications", "Bibliography", "Notes \& Email" and "Reports" to view other types of files that NVivo can import in those areas, and hover over an item to see the associated file extensions. We won’t be covering them all in this tutorial, but be sure to explore your options later.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_023.PNG' alt='The Import ribbon.' title='' width='866' height='202' />

Creating Codes and Coding
-------------------------

One of the main tasks NVivo is used for is coding. NVivo has a Codes section from the left menu, but if you expand it, you will see folders such as Codes, Sentiment, etc. These codes act like containers to hold all the references to that code.

If you have already decided upon codes ahead of time (following a deductive approach to coding), you can add these codes to NVivo and then start using them. Other times, as mentioned, you will be reading your materials in NVivo and creating codes as you go (an inductive approach to coding). And sometimes you will do a combination of this, where you have a rough idea of some codes you expect to see, but then new codes might emerge for you as your read through the materials. For this example, let’s try this combo method. First, we will create a few codes that we will use to code our materials, and then I will show you how to create codes on the fly as you are reading.

1\. From the Codes section on the left, **right click on the Codes folder** and **select New Code**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_024.PNG' alt='Left menu coding expanded, with the Codes context menu opened and a red box around the New Code option.' title='' width='773' height='724' />

2\. Alternatively, you can go to the **Create menu** and **select Code** to create a new code.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_025.PNG' alt='Left menu coding expanded, with the Codes context menu opened and a red box around the New Code option.' title='' width='790' height='590' />

3\. For the code name **call it “Budget”**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_026_0.PNG' alt='New Node Window with the name field outlined and completed.' title='' width='634' height='403' />

4\. You can add a description for your codes if you like. This lets you describe them in more detail and give examples of where it would be applied to understand how to use it in coding. We will just leave it blank for now. The nickname field is used if your code name is a bit longer, but you want a quick nickname to select from a list when coding. Our code name is short, so we don’t need a nickname in this case. Ignore the “Aggregate coding from children” option for now. We will discuss it later. So let’s just **select OK**. You should now see our new Budget code listed in the Codes folder.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_027.PNG' alt='New Node window with the OK button outlined.' title='' width='634' height='403' />

5\. **Repeat the last three steps to also create a code called “Maintenance.”** If you make a mistake, you can always right click on a code and select Delete to remove it (be careful with this option if you have started coding!) or select Code Properties to rename it or add a description and nickname. You should now have two codes.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_028.PNG' alt='Main window with nodes opened. Red box around the two nodes.' title='' width='976' height='596' />

6\. Now that we have a couple codes, let’s use them to do some coding. To open up one of our imported files, from the left menu, **under Files**, **go to the Interview folder, and double click on the first interview transcript** to open it in NVivo.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_029.PNG' alt='Rex box around the interview folder in the left menu and around the first interview.' title='' width='1039' height='595' />

Note: NVivo can open a lot of different file types directly in the tool. The files will be open as read\-only, meaning you can’t edit them. This is intentional to prevent error. However, if you happen to notice an error you want to correct, you can select Edit on the top left. Then you will be able to make changes to the file. You can deselect Edit when you're done to save the edits.

7\. With the file open, you can then read through it and code. **Highlight some text** you want to code, and then **right click and select Code Selection**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_030.PNG' alt='Some interview text selected, with an open context menu and a red box around code.' title='' width='808' height='622' />

8\. Next, **select the code you want to use to code** this text, such as Budget, and then **click Code Selection to Budget**. Now it is coded.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_031.PNG' alt='Select Code window with red boxes around budget and the OK button.' title='' width='430' height='591' />

Note: Generally, you want the text to match the code, but for now, don’t worry if the text doesn’t match, this is just to quickly show you how it works.

9\. Let’s look at an alternative quick way to code. This time before you code, **click on the Codes folder**. This should open up the Codes list next to your transcript.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_032.PNG' alt='In the left menu, outline around Nodes.' title='' width='715' height='595' />

10\. **Highlight some text** you want to code, and then **drag the highlighted text over to the code** you want to code it to. Let’s drag it over to the Maintenance code. This is a fast and visual way to code that lets you can see the full list of codes while you are coding.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Creating%20Codes_10_1_0.png' alt='A red box around highlighted text. An arrow points from the text to a red box around the maintenance code. ' title='' width='1270' height='475' />

11\. So far we have been coding using our pre\-made codes. However, sometimes, something unexpected might come up that you want to create a new code to code it. **Highlight some text**, and then **right click and select Code Selection...**

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_034.PNG' alt='Some interview text selected, with an open context menu and a red box around code.' title='' width='811' height='590' />

12\. Now, instead of selecting an existing code, **select Top\-Level Code** on the left.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_035.PNG' alt='Select Code window with a red box around New Node.' title='' width='432' height='590' />

13\. Here you can give it a name, for example, “Teamwork” and **select Code Selection to 'New Code'** to create a new code on the fly.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_036_0.PNG' alt='Select Code Window with a red outline around a new node named Teamwork and the OK button.' title='' width='428' height='587' />

14\. So far we have been coding Word documents, but let’s look at the PDFs we imported as well. First **close the current interview transcript** you have been working with.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_037.PNG' alt='Arrow to the Interview window close button.' title='' width='845' height='733' />

15\. **Go to the Focus Groups folder** and **open up “NYC Data Center FG1 Questionnaire 7\.”**

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_038.PNG' alt='Red box around the Focus groups folder and Questionnaire 7.' title='' width='1027' height='597' />

16\. This PDF file has been OCR’ed, meaning you can select text and code it as we have done before. **Try selecting some text**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_039.PNG' alt='Questionnaire 7 with some text selected.' title='' width='951' height='716' />

17\. **Now open up “NYC Data Center FG1 Questionnaire 14\.”**

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_040.PNG' alt='Red boxed around Questionnaire 14.' title='' width='960' height='595' />

18\. This PDF file has not been OCR’ed, meaning you can’t select the text and code it as we have done before. Instead NVivo treats this more like an image. **Select Region from the PDF Tools Menu at the top**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_041.PNG' alt='The region button in the pdf tools menu is highlighted.' title='' width='1474' height='120' />

19\. Draw a box to select part of the PDF. You will then be able to code this part as normal by right clicking on the box and selecting **Code Selection...** Generally, though, it is better to make sure that any PDFs you import into NVivo are OCR’ed for ease of coding. This will also be important when running queries, which we will look at later. For now, close these two PDFs.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_042.PNG' alt='Region box around text with a context menu has the code option highlighted.' title='' width='957' height='539' />

Note: If OCR’ing PDFs is new to you, [this guide](https://guides.library.illinois.edu/c.php?g=347520&p=4116755) might help.

20\. From the left menu, **under Coding, go to the Codes folder** and **double click on a code that has some references** (meaning it has been used to code some text). Here you will see all the snippets of text that were coded to this code.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_043.PNG' alt='Left menu with Nodes outlined. The first node is selected and open on the right.' title='' width='1307' height='592' />

21\. If you later realize that you mistakenly coded something you didn’t mean to code, you can uncode it. **Highlight one of the references listed**, and then **right click and select Uncode From This Code**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_044.PNG' alt='One of the node references is highlighted and the context menu has the uncode option outlined.' title='' width='1070' height='630' />

 

Working with Codes
------------------

1\. Before we work some more with Codes, **create two more codes called “Energy Efficiency” and “Water Consumption”**.

2\. Next, **code at least 5 small text fragments to each new code**.

3\. You can see now there are useful counts associated with our codes to see how many files have content that has been coded in that code, and how many text snippets or references have been coded into that code.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_045.PNG' alt='In the node list, the files and references columns are outlined.' title='' width='816' height='596' />

4\. You will notice that all of our codes are top\-level or parent codes, meaning we haven’t established a hierarchy, none of our codes are nested under other codes. NVivo can help you organize your codes in a hierarchical structure. You are often, in the end, trying to create a hierarchical codes list to group common codes together into broader categories and themes to help make sense of your coding. **Create a new code and call it Sustainability**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_046.PNG' alt='Node list with an open context menu and the new node option outlined.' title='' width='515' height='566' />

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_047.PNG' alt='New Node Window with the name field outlined and completed. Red box around the OK button.' title='' width='633' height='403' />

5\. You could use this code to group some of your existing codes. **Drag Energy Efficiency and Water Consumption onto the Sustainability code** (First click on a code to highlight, wait a moment, then drag it on).

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_048.PNG' alt='Energy Efficiency and Water Consumption Nodes selected, with arrows pointing to the Sustainability node.' title='' width='514' height='433' />

6\. Now you can see that they are grouped beneath. Codes grouped beneath another code are called Child Codes.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_049.PNG' alt='Red box around the sustainability node with the two nodes nested under it.' title='' width='510' height='468' />

7\. You can use Sustainability as its own broader code now in coding, or just keep it as a heading in the hierarchy. **Double click on Sustainability**. You should see an empty window pop up as there are no references coded to that code right now.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/NVivo14_intro_050.PNG' alt='The Sustainability node opened, with no references.' title='' width='1269' height='519' />

8\. **Right click on Sustainability** and **select Code Properties**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Working%20With%20Codes_8.png' alt='Context menu for the sustainability code with a red box around the Code Properties option.' title='' width='1017' height='825' />

9\. **Click the box next to Aggregate Coding from children**. Then **click OK**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Working%20With%20Codes_9.png' alt='Code properties window with the Aggregate coding for children box outlined and checked.' title='' width='633' height='403' />

10\. Now you should see all the references to Sustainability’s code, plus its children codes, show up in the window that popped\-up before (and is still open). You will need to decide how to want to handle your code hierarchies in terms of this aggregation for your own projects. In some cases, this is very useful, but it may affect queries where references are double counted for the parent and the child. We will talk more about queries later in the tutorial.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Working%20With%20Codes_10.png' alt='The Sustainability code opened, with all the references from child codes visible.' title='' width='1437' height='993' />

11\. In the window with all the Sustainability references, **highlight all the text**. A quick way to do this is to click anywhere in that window and press CTRL and “A” on your keyboard at the same time to select all.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Working%20With%20Codes_11.png' alt='The Sustainability code opened, with all the references selected.' title='' width='732' height='877' />

12\. Then **go to the Code ribbon menu** at the top, **select the Content drop\-down menu** and **pick Broad under Coding Context**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Working%20With%20Codes_12.png' alt='The Sustainability code text selected. In the Code ribbon, the Content drop-down menu is opened and the Broad option is outlined.' title='' width='1474' height='819' />

13\. You will see that the references have changed. There is grey text that isn’t coded, but comes directly before or after the coded text to give you more context for what you have coded. This is useful when examining small snippets of coded text. You can apply this Broad context (or explore the other options in the menu) any time you are presented with a list of references. **Close the tab** for now.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Working%20With%20Codes_13.png' alt='The Sustainability code opened, with grey text above and below each reference. One example outlined in red.' title='' width='723' height='427' />

14\. Another way to get a better idea of how your files are coded is to use coding stripes and highlighting. First, **go to your interviews folder**. You can see how many codes have been applied to the content and how many references in the document have been coded.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Working%20With%20Codes_14.png' alt='In the interviews folder, the codes and references columns are outlined.' title='' width='1072' height='718' />

15\. **Double click on an interview that has some coded references**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Working%20With%20Codes_15.png' alt='In the Interviews Folder, the first file is highlighted.' title='' width='770' height='318' />

16\. **From the Document ribbon, select the Coding Stripes drop\-down menu** and **pick All**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Working%20With%20Codes_16.png' alt='In the Document Tools ribbon, the Coding Stripes drop-down menu is open and All Coding is outlined in red.' title='' width='1209' height='717' />

17\. It will automatically select colours to differentiate the codes. You should see coloured stripes along the right to tell you what parts of the document have been coded and how. Note: You can customize the colours by right clicking on each code and selecting Color, and then picking your colour of choice. After you've set up all your colours, click anywhere on the text of the interview, selected the Coding Stripes drop\-down menu, and pick Item Colors instead of leaving Automatic Colors selected.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Working%20With%20Codes_17.png' alt='Red box around the coloured stripes along the right of the transcript text.' title='' width='1036' height='643' />

18\. Next, **from the Document ribbon, select the Highlight drop\-down menu** and pick **All Coding**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Working%20With%20Codes_18.png' alt='In the Document Tools ribbon, the Highlight drop-down menu is open and All Coding is outlined in red.' title='' width='1191' height='460' />

19\. You will see the coded text in yellow highlighting.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Working%20With%20Codes_19.png' alt='The coded transcript text is highlighted in yellow and outlined with a red box.' title='' width='964' height='293' />

 

Creating Notes
--------------

1\. Let’s move on to another use of NVivo. You can create different types of notes to capture your thoughts on some text in a file, a file itself, or the project as a whole. Let’s make a note about something that has come up in the text. **Open up one of the interview files, highlight some text, right click, and select New Annotation**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Creating%20Notes_1.png' alt='Some interview text selected, with an open context menu and a red box around New Annotation.' title='' width='1036' height='739' />

2\. A small table should pop up at the bottom where you can add your note. **Type out a small note**, such as “This is important!” When you’re done typing your note, just click on the document again. You will see that annotations are highlighted in blue.  If the text was also highlighted due to coding, it shows as green. **Close the file**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Creating%20Notes_2.png' alt='Interview text with an annotated text highlighted in blue and below a table with the annotation outlined in red.' title='' width='1023' height='879' />

3\. Let’s say instead that you want to make a note about this whole interview file that you had open. **Go to the Interviews folder and right click on an interview file**. **Select Memo Link** and then **Link to New Memo**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Creating%20Notes_3.png' alt='Context menu for an interview with the Memo link side pop-up menu open and Link to New Memo... outlined in red.' title='' width='876' height='680' />

4\. **Give your memo a name**, such as “Interview Memo” and **click OK**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Creating%20Notes_4.png' alt='New Memo window, with the name field and OK outlined in red.' title='' width='554' height='405' />

5\. You will be given a blank page where you can write a detailed memo about that file. Perhaps, for example, this interview was held in poor conditions, such as a noisy coffee shop, that might have influenced what was talked about. You could note that here.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Creating%20Notes_5.png' alt='Red box around the interview Memo tab.' title='' width='1018' height='566' />

6\. Once you close the window, the memo is saved and linked to this file. You should see a small icon next to the interview in the list for the memo link when you have the interview list opened completely (with no other files open to the right of it). **To view the memo link, right click on the file again, select Memo Link and then Open Linked Memo**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Creating%20Notes_6.png' alt='Red box around the linked Memo icon in the interview folder.' title='' width='627' height='326' />

7\. To see annotations you have created all in one place, using the left menu, **under Notes, select Annotations**. Double click on one to open up the file and see the highlighted text and the annotation highlighted in the table. To see the memo links, **under Notes,** **select Memos**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Creating%20Notes_7.png' alt='Left menu with Notes outlined in red.' title='' width='937' height='785' />

8\. Finally, you can also create a note that applies to the entire project, for example, maybe some ideas you have about how the research is going or new themes that are emerging. **Right click on Memos and select New Memo**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Creating%20Notes_8.png' alt='Memos folder context menu with the New Memo option outlined in red.' title='' width='526' height='756' />

9\. **Give it a name**, such as “Project Memo” and **click on OK**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Creating%20Notes_9.png' alt='New Memo window, with the name field and OK outlined in red.' title='' width='554' height='406' />

10\. **Type some notes**, such as “The project needs to be reviewed” and then **close it to save**. You can always double click on it from the list of memos to re\-open it.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Creating%20Notes_10.png' alt='Red box around the Project Memo tab.' title='' width='1020' height='417' />

 

Case Classification and Cases
-----------------------------

If you have demographics or other important attributes that you want to incorporate into your study, case classifications and cases can help. For example, if you were analyzing interview transcripts, you might want to create a case classification called “Interviewees” with attributes such as their name, age, education, job title, etc. Once your case classification is in place that defines what characteristics you want to capture for your interviewees, you could then create one case for each interviewee with those attributes filled in. So for example, if you interviewed someone named Geeta, you would create a case called Geeta (or some ID number if needed for confidentiality) with information about Geeta. You would then use that Geeta case to code all the files/content that are associated with Geeta (where the Case acts like a code). Later you can then run queries that incorporate that information to answer questions such as, do executives talk more about sustainability? We will talk about how to run queries later in the tutorial.

You can manually create case classifications and cases by using the left menu, under Cases. You can right click on case classification and create a new classification or right click on cases to create a new case. But often times, it is easier and more common to upload a spreadsheet with all the information for the cases. Let’s try that now.

1\. For our project, we have a spreadsheet called Interviewees. Open it up in Excel and take a look. It lists our interviewees and their attributes. NVivo would call this a classification sheet. Now close it.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/IntroNVivo1415WindowsExcelFileUpdate.png' alt='Excel file showing interviewees and attributes about then, such as Interview title, data centers managed, last major purchase or upgrade, role level, experience, and size of team. All attributes are categorical variables.' title='' width='1972' height='404' />

2\. **Go to the Import menu, and from the Classifications drop\-down menu, select Import Classification Sheets...**

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Case%20Classification_2.png' alt='Red box around the Import Ribbon and the Import Classification Sheet button.' title='' width='865' height='352' />

3\. **Browse to the Interviewees spreadsheet and click on Next**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/nvivo_workshop_win_074.png' alt='Import Classification Window with the browse button outlined in red.' title='' width='518' height='543' />

<img src='../scraped_files/129/nvivo_workshop_win_075.png' alt='Import Classification Sheet window file explorer at the workshop folder, Interviewees.xml selected. Red box around the open button.' title='' width='965' height='561' />

<img src='../scraped_files/129/nvivo_workshop_win_076.png' alt='Import Classification Window with the browse field completed, and Next outlined in red.' title='' width='522' height='546' />

4\. **From the Classification Type drop\-down menu, select Case Classification**. Keep the rest of the defaults (i.e., everything has a checkmark) and **click on Next**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/nvivo_workshop_win_077.png' alt='Import Classification Window with the classification type drop down menu open and the Case Classification option selected and outlined in red.' title='' width='522' height='547' />

5\. Our classification sheet’s first column provides the name of each case (i.e., the interviewee’s first name). So **select As names** if not already selected. Also keep Create new cases if they do not exist checked so that our cases will be created. Then **click on Next**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/nvivo_workshop_win_078.png' alt='Import Classification Window with As names selected and Next outlined in red.' title='' width='522' height='548' />

6\. This last step allows us to specify how dates, times and numbers should be imported. We can keep the defaults here. **Click on Finish**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/nvivo_workshop_win_079.png' alt='Import Classification Window with Finish outlined in red.' title='' width='522' height='546' />

7\. Using the left menu, **under Cases, select Cases** to see our newly created cases. These cases can now be used in coding the same way codes are used.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Case%20Classification_7.png' alt='Left menu Cases opened and a red box around the Cases list.' title='' width='948' height='600' />

8\. We can take advantage of NVivo’s autocoding features to allow us to identify the interviewee’s responses in a file and code them automatically into the appropriate case. **Using the left menu, under Data \> Files, go to the Interviews folder and right click on the interview transcript titled “Data Center Interview Transcript oct3\_2014”. Select Autocode…**

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Case%20Classification_8.png' alt='In the interviews folder, a context menu for the last transcript is open with Auto Code... highlighted.' title='' width='1078' height='744' />

9\. You are presented with a wizard with different autocoding features that I encourage you to explore on your own. For now, let’s **select Speaker name**. This is going to automatically code text based on speaker name. Then **click on Next**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Case%20Classification_9.png' alt='Auto Code Wizard Window with the Speaker name option selected and outlined in red. The Next button is highlighted.' title='' width='619' height='603' />

10\. Our transcripts are formatted in a consistent manner so we can always pick out who is speaking because the text is labeled as “INT:” for the interviewer’s words, and the person’s name in capital letters followed by a colon for the interviewee’s words. We need to tell NVivo who are all the unique speakers in this document. **Under Enter all speakers, type in “INT” and hit Enter. Then type in BASEL and hit the TAB key.** You should check the preview below to confirm that NVivo is picking up each unique speaker by highlighting them in different colours. If it looks correct, **click on Next**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Case%20Classification_10.png' alt='Auto Code Wizard Window with the a red box around the Enter all Speakers field, Preview, and the Next button.' title='' width='620' height='603' />

11\. **Make sure Add to existing classification is selected and from the drop\-down next to it, Interviewees is selected. Then click on Finish.** This should code everything that Basel said in the transcript with Basel’s case.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Case%20Classification_11.png' alt='Auto Code Wizard Window with a red box around Add to Existing classification and finish.' title='' width='618' height='601' />

12\. **Using the left menu, under Cases, click on Cases to see cases** again. **Double click on the BASEL case**. You should see everything that Basel said in his interview. These words are coded to this case. The BASEL case code is now linked to Basel’s interview responses.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Case%20Classification_12_0.png' alt='Cases open with Basel selected and a red box around the Basel window.' title='' width='1376' height='812' />

 

Save the Project
----------------

1\. While NVivo will ask you to save your project every 15 minutes, when you are done working on a project it is important to remember to save manually. **From the File Menu, select Save** to save the current project.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Save_1.png' alt='Red box around the file menu.' title='' width='859' height='582' /><img src='../scraped_files/129/Save_1_1.png' alt='In the file menu, red box around Save.' title='' width='588' height='378' />

2\. You can also save a project by clicking on the floppy disk icon on the top right of the menu bar, or pressing **CTRL\+S** on your keyboard.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Save_2.png' alt='Save button is highlighted' title='' width='1293' height='123' />

3\. Finally, you can close a project to return to the NVivo main screen. Once your project is saved, **go back to the File Menu and select Close**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Save_3.png' alt='In the file menu, red box around Close.' title='' width='524' height='385' />

 

Part 2 – Queries
================

In this second part of the tutorial we will be looking at queries. One advantage of putting all your documents and coding in one NVivo project, is that you then have the ability to query the information to gain more insights.

Queries work better for larger projects with a lot of coding already completed, so we’re going to work with the sample project that comes with NVivo for this next section.

This tutorial will provide you with several interspersed exercises to test your understanding. You can find the answers to these questions at the bottom of the tutorial.

 

Word Frequency and Text Queries
-------------------------------

1\. First, make sure you have saved and closed any previous projects you had open.

2\. **From the main screen, select Sample Project, Multi\-method**. This will open a ready\-made project that comes with NVivo. Data in this sample project is drawn from a two\-year research study (2008\-2009\) undertaken by researchers from the Duke University Nicholas School of the Environment at the Duke Marine Laboratory in Beaufort, N.C. The study documented community perceptions of development and land\-use change on coastal communities in the Down East area of Carteret County, North Carolina, USA.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_1.png' alt='The NVivo 14 main screen with the Sample Project button outlined.' title='' width='1314' height='663' />

3\. If an NVivo Tour window opens up, just close it for now.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_2.png' alt='Red box around the X to close the Tour popup' title='' width='721' height='499' />

4\. Let’s see how queries can help us make sense of this project. **Go to the Explore menu** to see all the queries available to you.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_4.png' alt='The explore tab in the top ribbon is selected and outlined in red.' title='' width='1214' height='646' />

5\. Windows users have a feature in NVivo called the Query Wizard that helps you decide upon the right query for the right task. It also helps break down the query so that you can understand the different options available. Let’s try that first. **Click on Query Wizard**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_5.png' alt='Red box around Query Wizard.' title='' width='1014' height='247' />

6\. The four options correspond to the first four query types we are going to explore – you can see them named on the right as you select different options. The first two options are great to use near the beginning of a project to get to know your content and help you with coding, the other queries work better once you’ve worked on your project and have done some coding and potentially added cases.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_6.png' alt='Query Wizard window with a red box around the four options on the left.' title='' width='602' height='466' />

7\. Let’s start with the second option – the Word Frequency query, which is described as “Identify frequently occurring terms in content.” If you don’t want to use the query wizard, you could also select Word Frequency from the Explore Ribbon directly. This is a great query to start with to get a sense of the content or topic of your data, by looking at the most common words used in a particular file or your whole project.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_7.png' alt='In the top Ribbon, under the explore tab, a red box around Word Frequency.' title='' width='1011' height='267' />

8\. From the wizard, **select the second option** and then **click on Next**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_8.png' alt='Query Wizard window with the second option selected and outlined in red. A red box around Next.' title='' width='602' height='471' />

9\. From here we can adjust the settings of our word frequency query. **Instead of 1000 words, change that to 100**. Minimum word length can remain at 3 characters.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_9.png' alt='In the word frequency Query criteria pop up, the display words are set to 100 and the minimum word length is set to 3. a red box surrounds the two sections. ' title='' width='600' height='466' />

10\. For grouping, this has some useful settings. If you select the second option, include words with the same stem, it can group a word with all its different word endings together, so they don’t take up distinct spots in our top 100 words. So for example, “run,” “runs,” and “running” would just be grouped together and then tallied once. You could go further and group synonyms, specializations or generalizations, but let’s just select stemming for this example. **Drag the slider to the second option** to Include words with same stem.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_10.png' alt='Query Wizard Window with the grouping settings outlined in red.' title='' width='600' height='468' />

11\. Once you’ve made your selections, **click on Next**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_11.png' alt='Query Wizard window with Next outlined in red.' title='' width='602' height='467' />

12\. Next, you’re asked where you want to search. This is a common setting for most queries. The default option is to search everywhere in the project. You could however, select particular files or folders that you want to search by choosing the second or third options. For example, if we only want to search Interviews, and we’ve been very organized and put all of our interview transcripts into a folder called Interviews, we could select the third option. However, our interview folder has a combination of text, plus audio and video files. If we want to only select the text transcripts, we’d select the second option. Let’s try that. **Choose Selected Items** **and** **click on the Select…** **button**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_12.png' alt='Query Wizard window with Selected Items outlined in red and selected, and a red box around Select...' title='' width='599' height='466' />

13\. Then **expand Files in the folder tree** to see our interview folder and select it to view its contents. **Put a checkmark next to the Interviews folder** to select everything in that folder to start, but then **unselect 2 videos and 1 audio file** (they have different icons). So only the text transcripts should be selected for our search. Then **click on OK**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_13.png' alt='Select Project Items window, File expanded and the Interviews folder selected. Red Box surrounding the file selection, with only the documents selected. Red box around OK.' title='' width='888' height='427' />

14\. Then**click on Next**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_14.png' alt='Query Wizard window with red box around Next.' title='' width='599' height='468' />

15\. Next, you’re asked if you just want to run this query once, or if you want to save it and add it to your project in the Search section on the left because you could see yourself running this query often. In this case, let’s just run it once, but later we will save a query that we want to revisit. Leave the defaults and **click on Run**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_15.png' alt='Query Wizard window with red box around Run.' title='' width='601' height='469' />

16\. Now we should see the results of our query. You should see a list of the top most common words in our interview transcripts, sorted with most common at the top. It tells you how many times the word (or group of similar words in our case) occurred and the last column shows you what words were grouped together. Note: If you double click on any word in the list, you're given a list displaying each instance of the word in context.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_16.png' alt='Word Frequency Results.' title='' width='717' height='748' />

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_26a.png' alt='In the Word Frequency query, there is a red box around the word 'people' ' title='' width='992' height='565' />

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_26b.png' alt='Word Frequency Results for a single word.' title='' width='996' height='921' />

17\. Word frequency lists normally ignore stop words, which are really common words that wouldn’t be useful to analysis. For English, these are words like “a,” “the,” “and,” etc. When you’re looking at this list of results, if you see a word that doesn’t really have much meaning in this context, such as “things,” you could add it to the stop words list and re\-run the query so it’ll ignore it. To do this, **right click on “things”** and **select Add To Stop Words List**. As we had stemming turned on, it presents you with all the words you’ll be adding to the Stop Words list to check. You can remove individual words from this list if you want. When you’re ready, **click on OK**. Then **click on Run Query** at the top right to re\-run the query. You should see that **“things” is now missing from the list**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_17.png' alt='In the results summary, context menu for the word Things open, with the Add To Stop Words option highlighted. Red box around Run Query.' title='' width='1416' height='928' />

18\. To see the Stop Words list, and even reset it, **go to the File menu, and under Project Information, select Project Properties**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_18a.png' alt='The top menu in NVivo with a red box around the file button. ' title='' width='1345' height='118' /><img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_18b_0.png' alt='File Menu screen with a red box around Project Properties.' title='' width='846' height='525' />

19\. Here you can select the Text Content Language. The default is English (US), but you can see other options. This doesn’t affect the interface, but is important for certain queries, such as word frequency queries and affects the stop words list. So for example, you could have an English interface for NVivo, but be analyzing interview transcripts that are in French, by selecting French here. **Click on the Stop Words button** to see the list of stop words in use. From here, you could select reset to reset the list to the default, if you wish. Let’s just **click cancel twice for now** and **go back to the results of our query**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_19.png' alt='Project Properties window with the General tab open. Red box around the Text content language and Stop Words...' title='' width='608' height='496' /><img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_19b.png' alt='Stop Words window.' title='' width='378' height='313' />

20\. You can also export these results into a spreadsheet. **Right click on the table** and **select Export List**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_20.png' alt='Context menu for the summary table with the export list... option outlined in red.' title='' width='954' height='664' />

21\.**Browse to the workshop folder, give the file a name or keep the default and click on Save**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_21.png' alt='Save As window in the workshop folder.' title='' width='1184' height='712' />

22\. If we then go back to the query results tab, on the right hand side, you will see 4 tabs. We are in the summary tab.**Click on Word Cloud**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_22.png' alt='Red box around the four tabs on the right of the results.' title='' width='953' height='676' />

23\. This shows the most frequent words, where the larger the word is, the more frequently it occurs, which is a common way to display this type of result. (Might take a few seconds to load).

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_23.png' alt='Red box around the references tabs on the right of the results.' title='' width='895' height='888' />

24\. On the ribbon at the top, you will see a new context\-specific menu called Word Frequency Query that gives you different themes you can choose to customize your word cloud.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_24.png' alt='Red box around Query Tools on the top menu.' title='' width='968' height='117' />

25\. You can also **right click on the word cloud and export it as an image or PDF** to use later in a report.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_25.png' alt='Context menu on the word cloud with the Export Word Cloud... option outlined in red.' title='' width='895' height='889' />

26\. **Go back to the word frequency query results window**. **Click on the third tab, Tree Map**. A Tree Map is an alternative visualization for word frequencies. The size of the rectangle is proportional to the frequency, and the most frequent word will always be found in the top left corner, and the least frequent will be in the bottom right corner. Tree maps are more commonly used to show parts to whole with hierarchies (so a more complex rectangular pie chart), so then are not ideal for visualizing word frequency.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_27.png' alt='Red box around the Tree Map tabs on the right of the results.' title='' width='998' height='892' />

27\. **Click on the final tab, Cluster Analysis**. This is a visualization where words that co\-occur are clustered together in a hierarchical tree diagram called a dendrogram. You can zoom in using the slider on the bottom right. You can browse to see if there are some surprising groupings.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_28.png' alt='Red box around the Cluster Analysis tabs on the right of the results.' title='' width='999' height='927' />

Note: NVivo’s visualization options are limited, and you can often get better visualizations by exporting your query results and importing them into other tools more suited for data visualization. If you’re interested in learning more tools and techniques for this, check out our [data visualization guide](https://mdl.library.utoronto.ca/dataviz/getting-started)!

28\. Once you’re done looking at the results of a query, you can just **click on the x to close the query results window**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_29.png' alt='Red box around the query results window close button.' title='' width='1000' height='623' />

29\. Next, let’s look at the Text Search query, which is described as “See where particular terms occur in the content” if you are using the query wizard. But this time, let’s **go to the Explore menu and select Text Search directly**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_30.png' alt='In the Ribbon, under the explore tab, Text Search is outlined in red.' title='' width='1077' height='123' />

30\. You can use it to find a word or phrase. You can search for phrases by putting them in quotation marks. Let’s try looking for mentions of "family". **Type “family” in the search box and choose With stemmed words**, so that it will also search for “families” similar to what we did in the Word Frequency query. Note: You can run more complicated searches using [operators](https://help-nv.qsrinternational.com/14/win/Content/queries/special-characters-operators.htm).

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_31.png' alt='In the Text Search Query window, the search field is outlined in red and completed with family. A red box is around the With stemmed words option.' title='' width='1000' height='416' />

31\. Next, we select where it should search. As before, the default is all the documents in the project. Let’s keep the default this time and just run the query. **Click on Run Query**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_32.png' alt='In the Text Search Query window, a red box outlines the Search in settings and Run Query.' title='' width='995' height='272' />

32\. You will be presented with a list of project files that contain that reference. You can **double click on a file to see the references**. Try that with the item called “Susan,” which you can see has 6 references.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_33.png' alt='In the Text Search Query window, a red box outlines the Susan file in the summary table.' title='' width='973' height='835' />

33\. This opens up Susan’s interview transcript. You can use this to help find references that you might want to code.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_34_0.png' alt='Red box around the open Susan file. All mentions of family a highlighted in yellow.' title='' width='999' height='927' />

34\. If you go **back to the query results**, you will see on the right, the Reference tab. You can **click on the Reference tab** to see all of the references together in one page.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_35.png' alt='Red box around the Text Search Query window tab and the Summary tab.' title='' width='998' height='928' />

35\. Other tabs on the right, such as text, PDF, video and dataset, only show you references in that type of content, to narrow down your search.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_36.png' alt='In the Text Search Query window, a red box outlines the four tabs below Summary.' title='' width='1002' height='928' />

36\. **Click on the final tab, Word Tree**, which shows you what words often come before and after the term or phrase you searched for. This is useful to understand how that word or phrase is being used.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/WordText_37.png' alt='In the Text Search Query window, a red box outlines the Word Tree tab.' title='' width='1001' height='928' />

37\. Go back to the **Summary** tab. Where it says **Spread to** just below the search box, drop\-down and select **Custom Context**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/IntroNVivo1415WindowsTextSearchUpdate1.png' alt='NVivo text search interface showing Summary tab on right and Spread to drop-down highlighted.' title='' width='1614' height='1125' />

38\. From the pop\-up window, select **Surrounding paragraph** and click on **OK**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/IntroNVivo1415WindowsTextSearchUpdate2.png' alt='Surround paragraph option and OK button are highlighted in Spread Coding pop-up window.' title='' width='619' height='562' />

39\. Re\-run the query to grab more than just the word, but the surrounding paragraph.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/IntroNVivo1415WindowsTextSearchUpdate3a.png' alt='NVivo text search interface with the run query button highlighted.' title='' width='1608' height='1119' />

40\. We can then save the results in a code. In a way, it autocodes the search term, and the words around the search term to a new code we can call Family. **Click on Save Results…** at the top right.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/IntroNVivo1415WindowsTextSearchUpdate3b.png' alt='NVivo text search interface with Save Results... button highlighted.' title='' width='1617' height='1132' />

41\. For the location, **click on Select...** and **pick Codes**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/IntroNVivo1415WindowsTextSearchUpdate4.png' alt='Store Query Results pop-up window with the Select button next to Location highlighted.' title='' width='720' height='380' /><img src='../scraped_files/129/IntroNVivo1415WindowsTextSearchUpdate5.png' alt='Select Location pop-up window with Codes and the OK button highlighted.' title='' width='558' height='610' />

42\.**Call it “Family”**, **uncheck Open results**, and **click on OK**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/IntroNVivo1415WindowsTextSearchUpdate6.png' alt='Store Query Results pop-up window with Family filled in for the name, Open results unchecked, and the OK button highlighted.' title='' width='720' height='380' />

43\. Go to Codes and you should see a new code called Family.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/IntroNVivo1415WindowsTextSearchUpdate7.png' alt='NVivo main interface with Codes option on the left highlighted.' title='' width='1288' height='960' />

44\. If you double click on it, you’ll see all the results from the query. So, this is a way to do some coding through text searches.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/IntroNVivo1415WindowsTextSearchUpdate8.png' alt='NVivo interface showing that if you double click on Family you see a reference list of family results.' title='' width='1509' height='1239' />

Coding Queries
--------------

1\. Okay, now let’s move on. **Close any query results tabs that you have open**.

2\. The next few queries I am going to show you are better to use when you have done some coding, as they can help you gain insight from all your work coding your content. For example, you could use these to find potential connections between codes, or connections between a code and a certain demographic.

3\. Let’s start with Coding queries. You can use these to find all content coded at selected codes, a combination of codes, or a combination of codes and attributes. You can go to the **Explore menu**, and from the **Queries drop\-down menu, select Coding,** or it is described as “Search for content based on how it is coded” in the Query Wizard. So for example, let’s say you want to see if there is content coded as both “memorable quote” and “real estate development,” and you only want to see references that are from residents of Marshallberg – you can do this with a Coding query. Let’s access it through the Explore menu, as we can create a more complex query that way. **Go to the Explore menu, and from the Queries drop\-down menu, select Coding**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/CodingQueries_3.png' alt='In the top Ribbon, under the explore tab, a red box around Coding.' title='' width='1166' height='314' />

4\. We can keep the defaults for now, which only finds references that are coded with all the codes listed. So we just need to **click on the ‘…’ button** next to the All Selected Codes or Cases drop\-down menu to **select the two codes we want.**

<img src='../scraped_files/129/CodingQueries_4.png' alt='In the Coding Query Results Preview Window, a red box around the ellipses button.' title='' width='875' height='401' />

5\. Select**“Memorable quote” and “Real estate development.”** Then **click OK**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/CodingQueries_5.png' alt='Select Project Items Window with the Nodes folder open and Memorable quotes and Real Estate development selected and outlined in red. Red box around OK.' title='' width='890' height='430' />

6\. Now let’s **click on Run Query** to see the results.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/CodingQueries_6.png' alt='In the Coding Query Results Preview Window, a red box around Run Query.' title='' width='872' height='396' />

7\. You are shown all the results, but you can also click on the Summary tab to see how many results you got. We can see there are a few results in interviews and survey responses.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/CodingQueries_7.png' alt='In the Coding Query window, a red box outlines the Summary tab.' title='' width='874' height='439' />

8\. We can narrow this down further, to just quotes from residents of Marshallberg. To do that, **click on the plus sign at the top right to add another parameter to our search**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/CodingQueries_8.png' alt='In the Coding Query Results Preview Window, a red box around the add parameter button.' title='' width='875' height='852' />

9\. For this new row, we **use the All Selected Codes or Cases drop\-down menu to select Any case where**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/CodingQueries_9.png' alt='The code or case dropdown menu outlined in red with Any case where selected.' title='' width='872' height='262' />

10\. Next **click on the … button**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/CodingQueries_10.png' alt='In the Coding Query Results Preview Window, a red box around the ellipses button for Any case where.' title='' width='877' height='264' />

11\. Then **expand Person, select Township, and click OK**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/CodingQueries_11.png' alt='Select Project Items Window with the Case Classifications folder open and township outlined in red.' title='' width='889' height='428' />

12\. **From the far right drop\-down, select “Marshallberg.”** (You might have to scroll to the right to see this.) So the query says “All” at the top left, meaning all of these conditions must be true. Then one line says that the content must be coded with both nodes, Memorable quotes and Real estate, and then the other line says AND the person who said this must be from Marshallberg.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/CodingQueries_12.png' alt='Red box around the open dropdown menu beside equals value, with Marshallberg selected.' title='' width='875' height='487' />

13\. **Click on Run Query** again. This time you can see we get just one large memorable quote on real estate from Mary and James, who are from Marshallberg.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/CodingQueries_13.png' alt='In the Coding Query Results Preview window, in the results table, a red box around the one entry.' title='' width='873' height='389' />

14\. We might not want to save the results, but we might want to save this query to re\-run again in the future as we continue to code. To do that, **click on Save Criteria at the top right.**

<img src='../scraped_files/129/CodingQueries_14.png' alt='In the Coding Query Results Preview Window, a red box around Save Criteria' title='' width='876' height='391' />

15\.**Give it the name “Marshallberg Quotes on Real Estate” and click on OK**. Then **close the query results tab**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/CodingQueries_15.png' alt='Coding Query Window, with the name field completed and outlined in red. Red box around OK.' title='' width='553' height='546' />

16\. You can find this query now savedif you go to the left menu, **under Queries, select Query Criteria**. You can double click on it at any time to re\-run the query.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/CodingQueries_16.png' alt='In the left menu, under Queries, a red box around Query Critera. In the Queries list, a red box around Mashallberg Quotes on Real Estate.' title='' width='1373' height='813' />

 

### Test Your Understanding 2

Using the Explore menu option run a Coding query for the project to find interview content coded as “Infrastructure,” “Policy, management,” OR “Real estate development” where the interviewees are from Harkers Island. How many references did you find?

(Hint: You will have to change an option to say Any instead of All to satisfy the “or” condition, different than in the demonstration.)

Matrix Coding and Crosstab Queries
----------------------------------

1\. Next up are Matrix Coding queries. These allow you to see coding intersections between two lists of items. It is called Matrix Coding Query in the Explore Ribbon or described as “Find coding intersections between two lists of items” in the Query Wizard. So for example, let’s say you want to see which interviewees (based on cases) had the most positive and negative attitudes (based on coding) \- you can do this with a Matrix Coding query. **Go to the Explore menu and select Matrix Coding Query**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/MatrixCrosstab_1.png' alt='In the top Ribbon, under the explore tab, a red box around Matrix Coding Query.' title='' width='1017' height='123' />

2\. This query is formed using drag and drop. First, **using the left menu, under Cases, go to People, and then expand Interview Participants**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/MatrixCrosstab_2.png' alt='In the left menu, under Cases, a red box around the People folder. In the People folder, a red box around the expand button for Interview Participants.' title='' width='1478' height='695' />

3\.**Highlight all of the interviewees by clicking on the first one, holding down the Shift key, and then clicking on the last one**. Then **drag and drop them on the left side of the matrix query under Rows**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/MatrixCrosstab_3.png' alt='Under Interview Participants, all cases are selected and outlined in red, with an arrow pointing to the Rows field of the Matrix Coding Query window.' title='' width='1171' height='928' />

4\. Then, **using the left menu, under Coding, click on Codes**, and then **go to Attitude and expand it**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/MatrixCrosstab_4.png' alt='In the left menu, under Coding, a red box around the Codes folder. In the Nodes folder, a red box around the expand button for Attitude.' title='' width='801' height='681' />

5\.**Highlight all the attitude child codes** and then **drag and drop them on the right side** of the matrix query under Columns.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/MatrixCrosstab_5.png' alt='Under Attitude, all child codes are selected and outlined in red, with an arrow pointing to the Columns field of the Matrix Coding Query window.' title='' width='1166' height='544' />

6\. **Click on Run Query** to see the results. You will see a grid or matrix with the number of references where those codes and cases intersect.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/MatrixCrosstab_6.png' alt='In the Matrix Coding Query Results Preview Window, a red box around Run Query.' title='' width='965' height='345' />

7\. To see the results more clearly and point out interesting patterns,use the shading options available from the top left of the Matrix ribbon. **Scroll down and select the purple option**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/MatrixCrosstab_7.png' alt='In the Ribbon, the Matrix tab is outlined in red and under the Matrix tab, the second Cell Shading option is highlighted.' title='' width='1170' height='458' />

8\. We can see that the darker the purple, the more two items intersect. In this case, we can see for example that Barbara had strong positive and negative references, Thomas’s interview was more negative than positive, and William’s was only positive.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/MatrixCrosstab_8.png' alt='In the Matrix Coding Query Results window, a red box around the results table.' title='' width='963' height='776' />

9\. **Click on the Chart tab on the right**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/MatrixCrosstab_9.png' alt='In the Matrix Coding Query Results Preview Window, a red box around the Chart tab.' title='' width='963' height='584' />

10\. You will see the results displayed in a chart. The default is a 3D bar graph.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/MatrixCrosstab_10.png' alt='In the Query Results Window, the Chart preview is highlighted.' title='' width='964' height='922' />

11\. You can select other chart types from the Chart ribbon above to change it. Again, NVivo’s visualization options are limited, and these graphs are often not the best way to display your data. In this scenario the shaded matrix view offers a clear visualization of the data.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/MatrixCrosstab_11_0.png' alt='On the ribbon, the visuals tab is outlined in red. A red box around the Type options.' title='' width='1164' height='960' />

12\. **Click on the Coding Matrix tab on the right**. Then right click on the table, and go to Cell Contents. You will see that the default number shown is coding references, but there are a lot of other options to consider to explore the data in different ways. For example, change it to Words Coded, you can see that Charles had a lot of negative things to say. **Once you have finished examining the results, close the query results tab**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/MatrixCrosstab_12.png' alt='In the Matrix Coding Query Results Preview window, a red box around the Coding Matrix tab. An open context menu for the results table with the cell content dropdown menu open and outlined in red, and with Coding References checked..' title='' width='1170' height='926' />

13\. Let’s move on to the last query we will look at, Crosstab queries. Crosstab queries are similar to Matrix Coding queries, but you can expand out all the categories for an attribute along the columns automatically. For example, to determine which codes came up most by Township of respondent. **Go to the Explore menu, and from the Queries drop\-down menu, select Crosstab**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/MatrixCrosstab_13.png' alt='In the top Ribbon, under the explore tab, a red box around Queries and Crosstab.' title='' width='1167' height='444' />

14\. This query is partially formed using drag and drop. First, **using the left menu, under Coding, select Codes**. **Highlight all the top\-level codes** (make sure none of the Code categories are expanded) and **then drag and drop them on the left side of the Crosstab query tab under Codes**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/MatrixCrosstab_14.png' alt='In the left menu, under Coding, a red box around the Codes folder. Under Codes, all codes are selected and outlined in red, with an arrow pointing to the codes field of the Crosstab Query window.' title='' width='1479' height='785' />

15\. The default option for the Crosstab codes against is attributes. **For Classification, select Person, and for Attribute 1, select Township, from the drop\-down menus**. This Crosstab query will create a matrix where the codes are along the rows, and for the columns, it will take all the values of one attribute (in this case, Township) and use those for the column headers. Then it will tally where they intersect.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/MatrixCrosstab_15.png' alt='In the Crosstab Query Window, Crosstab codes against is set to Attributes, Classification is set to person, and Attribute 1 is set to Township. A red box outlines these three settings.' title='' width='892' height='394' />

16\. **Click on Run Query to see the results**. You will see a matrix with the number of references where those codes and attributes intersect.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/MatrixCrosstab_16.png' alt='In the Crosstab Query window, a red box around Run Query.' title='' width='893' height='396' />

17\. Like with the Matrix Coding, **use the shading options available from the top left of the Crosstab ribbon to see the patterns more clearly**. If we select the green option, we can see that the darker the green, the more two items intersect.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/MatrixCrosstab_17.png' alt='In the Crosstab Query Results window, a red box around the results table. In the menu bar, the green shading selected is highlighted. ' title='' width='1215' height='763' />

18\. Again, we can **right click on the table, and go to Cell Contents to change what is displayed**. In this case, **try selecting Coding Presence**. Often times you might not have a big enough data set to gain meaning from the numerical values for coding references, for example, but you can at least see where there is an intersection at all or not. For example, we see that the code of a “Sense of Community” has only been used on data for a few townships. Normally people don’t report these numbers, but use them to gain insight into their project.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/MatrixCrosstab_18a.png' alt='In the Crosstab Query window, a context menu for the results table with the Cell Content dropdown menu open and a red box around Coding Presence.' title='' width='933' height='376' /><img src='../scraped_files/129/MatrixCrosstab_18b.png' alt='In the Crosstab Query window, a red box outlines the results table.' title='' width='934' height='606' />

19\. You’ll see that NVivo also offers three other query types: Coding Comparison Queries, which are used when working on a team to see how much agreement there is between team members on coding, and Compound and Group Queries that are used to create more complicated queries combining elements from the other query types we have discussed. While these will not be covered in this tutorial, you are encouraged to play around with these queries on your own time to learn more.

 

### Test Your Understanding 3

Using the Explore menu options run a Matrix Coding query on social media content only, where the columns are the attitude child codes (positive, negative, etc.) and the rows are the remaining top\-level codes (Balance, Economy, etc.). What two codes have the most negative references?

Next run a Crosstab query, where the rows are the top\-level codes (Balance, Economy, etc.) and the Person attribute is Education Level. What code was coded the most by coding references for people whose highest level of education completed is undergraduate college?

Export Data
-----------

1\. We’re already discussed how you can export the results of your queries, but you can also export your codes as a list or its references. **To export your full list of codes, first open up your Codes list and select at least one code**. **Go to the Share menu, and from the Export drop\-down menu, select Export List**. This will save all of your codes in a spreadsheet. It will include the number of files coded with that code, and the number of references.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Exporting_1_1.png' alt='In the top Ribbon, under the Share tab, a red box around Export and Export List.' title='' width='933' height='237' />

2\. **Browse to your workshop folder, name your file or keep the default and click on Save**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Exporting_2_0.png' alt='Save As window with the File name field completed and a red box around Save.' title='' width='1185' height='710' />

3\. You can also export your codebook, which lists your codes and their descriptions to understand when a code is normally used. Again, **go to the Share menu, and from the Export drop\-down menu, select Export Codebook.**

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Exporting_3.png' alt='In the top Ribbon, under the Share tab, a red box around Export Codebook.' title='' width='832' height='234' />

4\.**Select Include number of files and references**. This creates a Word document with this information. **Keep the defaults and click on OK**.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Exporting_4.png' alt='Export Codebook window with a red box around OK.' title='' width='397' height='442' />

5\. Finally, you can also export all the references for a particular set of codes. To do this, first **select your subset of codes**. For example, select Balance and Community Change.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Exporting_5_0.png' alt='In Codes, a red box around Balance and Community change.' title='' width='766' height='391' />

6\. Then **right\-click on the codes and select Export, and then Export Codes...**

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Exporting_6_0.png' alt='In the code pop-up menu, export is selected and highlighted. Export codes is also highlighted. ' title='' width='768' height='505' />

7\. From this window, you have three options. You can select Entire Content, which creates a local website where you can navigate through all the references; however, I would recommend either Reference View or Summary View. Reference View creates a list of each reference, similar to what you would see if you double clicked on the node. You can save this list as a Word document, text file or PDF. Summary View provides a table that shows you how many times that node was coded by project item. You can save this list as an Excel file, Word document, text file or PDF. Try saving both the reference view and summary view formats. Open up all the files you have exported to see their contents.

<img src='../scraped_files/129/Exporting_7.png' alt='Export Options window with a red box around the export options and with Summary View selected.' title='' width='432' height='605' />
